The project uses Self Destruction pattern.
Only the owner can destroy the contract.

#Description
Used for terminating a contract, which means removing it forever from the blockchain.
Once destroyed, itâ€™s not possible to invoke functions on the contract and no transactions will be logged in the ledger.

This is done incase the project is terminated.
